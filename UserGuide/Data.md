# Data Tab


The second item on the application ribbon is the Data tab.  This tab gives the user the tools to load or update data, define the inputs and outputs of a model, derive new variables from the source data and build and generate forecasts from a number of different modelling approaches.  The Data tab is the primary tab for the forecasting application.  A typical forecasting process is shown in Figure 11.

The Data ribbon breaks down into 7 different groups, as described in Table 4.



| Group          | Description                                                                                                          |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Importers | Mechanisms to import data into the application                                                                       |
| Data Columns   | Mechanisms to create derived columns, delete and rename these columns                                                |
| Model Type     | Enables you to choose either a simple single model or a decomposition forecast model (more details in section 5.4)   
| Model Rows     | Tools to specify which rows form the training and validation sets                                                    |
| Model Columns  | Tools to allow the user to define which columns form inputs and which column is to be the target/forecasted variable |
| Model Design   | Allows the user to select which forecasting technique is applied and the settings to be used                         |
| Forecasting    | Allows the user to train the model and then generate the forecast                                                    |
